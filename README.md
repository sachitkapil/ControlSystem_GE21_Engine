# ControlSystem_GE_21_Engine
Analysis and Design of Multivariable Control System for a GE-21 Engine

The non-linear model is linearized at two operating points.
• Linear Model obtained at Operating Point 1 is a three input - three output system. It consists of two
states.
• Linear Model obtained at Operating Point 2 is a two input - two output system. It consists of two
states.
• Three different control system techniques are applied for the obtained plant models.
